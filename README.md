My implementation of the fizzbuzz game in Javascript

## Description
This is a simple javascript implementation for the  [fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) game. I've done it while studying and preparing for job interviews as it is ([apparently](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/15623/fizzbuzz-really)), a quite common challenge.

While [here](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest) you can find several different approaches, my idea was to expand a bit on the concept, namely:

 - What if we had a _players_ array and cycled through it, having the players "say" their response, instead of simply counting up to 100?
 - What if the players had a chance of _failing_ their response?
 - When a player fails, how to kick him/her off the player pool and resume play?
 - Last man/woman standing is the winner!

## Instructions
Just add the script.js file to your HTML document and inspect the console. Alternatively, you can see it in action [here](http://jsbin.com/zawujadavu/edit?js,console).
